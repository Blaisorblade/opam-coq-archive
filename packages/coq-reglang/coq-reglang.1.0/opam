synopsis: "Representations of regular languages (i.e., regexps, various types of automata, and WS1S) with equivalence proofs, in Coq and MathComp"
description: """
This library provides definitions and verified translations between
different representations of regular languages: various forms of
automata (deterministic, nondeterministic, one-way, two-way),
regular expressions, and the logic WS1S. It also contains various
decidability results and closure properties of regular languages."""
