description: """
This is a HOAS-based encoding of the pi-calculus (as originally
conceived by Milner, Parrow and Walker in "A Calculus of Mobile
Processes" Parts I-II, Information and Computation n. 100)
together with the formal verification of a large part of the
metatheory of Strong Late Bisimilarity."""
