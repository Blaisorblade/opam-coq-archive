synopsis: "Modules over monads and lambda-calculi"
description: """
We define a notion of module over a monad and use it to
propose a new definition (or semantics) for abstract
syntax (with binding constructions). Using our notion of
module, we build a category of `exponential' monads,
which can be understood as the category of
lambda-calculi, and prove that it has an initial object
(the pure untyped lambda-calculus)."""
