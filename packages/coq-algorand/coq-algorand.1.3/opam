synopsis: "A verified model of the Algorand consensus protocol in Coq"
description: """
The Algorand consensus protocol provides the foundation for a
decentralized digital currency and transactions platform. This project
provides a model of the protocol in Coq, expressed as a transition
system over global states in a message-passing distributed system.
Included is a formal proof of safety for the transition system."""
