synopsis: "A verified model of Algorand in Coq"
description: """
Algorand is a consensus protocol that provides the foundation for a
decentralized digital currency and transactions platform.
This is a formal model of Algorand in Coq, expressed
as a transition system over global states in a distributed system.
Included is a full formal proof of safety for the transition system.
